Materials and methods: A dataset of 2725 lung cancer images was used, covering various subtypes: adenocarcinoma (552 images), SCC (380 images), small cell lung cancer (SCLC) (307 images), large cell carcinoma (215 images), and pulmonary carcinoid tumors (180 images). The images were extracted as 2D slices from 3D CT scans, with tumor-containing slices selected from scans obtained across five healthcare centers. The number of slices per patient varied between 7 and 30, depending on tumor visibility. CT images were preprocessed using standardization, cropping, and Gaussian smoothing to ensure consistency across scans from different imaging instruments used at the centers. Radiomic features, including first-order statistics (FOS), shape-based, and texture-based features, were extracted using the PyRadiomics library. A DeepCNN architecture, integrated with attention mechanisms in the second convolutional block, was used for deep feature extraction, focusing on diagnostically important regions. The dataset was split into training (60%), validation (20%), and testing (20%) sets. Various feature selection techniques, such as Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), were used, and multiple machines learning models, including XGBoost and Stacking, were evaluated using accuracy, sensitivity, and AUC metrics. The model’s reproducibility was validated using ICC analysis across different imaging conditions. Results: The hybrid model, which integrates DeepCNN with attention mechanisms, outperformed traditional methods. It achieved a testing accuracy of 92.47%, an AUC of 93.99%, and a sensitivity of 92.11%. XGBoost with NMF showed the best performance across all models, and the combination of radiomic and deep features improved classification further. Attention mechanisms played a key role in enhancing model performance by focusing on relevant tumor areas, reducing misclassification from irrelevant features. This also improved the performance of the 3D Autoencoder, boosting the AUC to 93.89% and accuracy to 93.24%. Conclusions: This study shows that combining radiomic features with deep learning—especially when enhanced by attention mechanisms—creates a powerful and accurate framework for classifying lung cancer subtypes.

To bypass static protection techniques, such as blocking certain IPs in firewalls or DNS server deny lists, malware can use algorithmically generated domains (AGD). Many different solutions based on deep learning have been proposed during the last years to detect this type of domains. However, there is a lack of ability to compare the proposed models because there is no common framework that allows experiments to be replicated under the same conditions. Each previous work shows its evaluation results, but under different experimentation conditions and even with different datasets. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing a software framework, dubbed RAMPAGE (fRAMework to comPAre aGd dEtectors), focused on training and comparing machine learning models for AGD detection. Furthermore, we propose a new model that uses logistic regression and, using RAMPAGE to obtain a fair comparison with different state-of-the-art models, achieves slightly better results than those obtained so far. In addition, the dataset built from real-world samples for evaluation, as well as the source code of RAMPAGE, are also publicly released to facilitate its use and promote experimental reproducibility in this research field. © 2025 The Author(s)","Algorithmically generated domains detection; Evaluation; Machine learning models; Malware; Neural network models","Deep learning; Error detection; Internet protocols; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Neural networks; Algorithmically generated domain detection; Command and control; Condition; Domain detections; Evaluation; Machine learning models; Malwares; Neural network model; Reproducibilities; Software frameworks; Life cycle","","","","","MIMFA; Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO; PRTR; Ministerio de Universidades, MIU; European Commission, EC; Universidad de Zaragoza, UZ; University, Industry and Innovation Department of the Aragonese Government, (CS.007); European Regional Development Fund, ERDF, (TED2021-131115A-I00); European Regional Development Fund, ERDF; Instituto Nacional de Ciberseguridad, INCIBE, (T21-23R); Instituto Nacional de Ciberseguridad, INCIBE","We would like to sincerely thank the reviewers for their constructive comments and insightful suggestions, which have significantly contributed to improving the quality and clarity of this work.

Materials and methods: HNC patients opting for RT at our center. The patients were randomly allocated to either the muscle training group or the control group in a 1:1 ratio. The magnitude of the setup error was measured at the levels of the clivus, C4 and C7 vertebrae respectively. The Van Herk formula was used to determine appropriate planning target volume (PTV) margins. (Trial Registration: ChiCTR2000041009, registration date: 12/16/2020) Results: A total of 221 patients were analyzed, with 109 assigned to the muscle training group and 112 enrolled in the control group. Compared with the control group, the setup errors in the X and Z direction of the clivus and the Z direction of C4 and C7 in the muscle training group were significantly lower (p = 0.031, < 0.001, < 0.001, < 0.001 respectively). The required PTV margins in the Z direction increased from 2.13 mm in the clivus to 3.63 mm in C7 in the muscle training group and from 2.89 mm in the clivus to 4.37 mm in C7 in the control group. Multivariate linear regression analysis demonstrated that the impact of neck muscle training, weight fluctuation, and cervical curvature on the setup error in the Z direction at C7 differed significantly (p = 0.000, 0.001, and 0.008, respectively). Conclusion: Neck muscle training can reduce setup errors and PTV margins in the anterior-posterior direction in patients undergoing RT for HNC. © The Author(s) 2025.","Head and neck cancer; Neck muscle training;

The development of new therapeutic agents to reduce postoperative adhesions needs animal models that closely mirror human pathophysiology. In this study, we established a novel surgical adhesion model in cynomolgus monkeys, which are characteristically similar to humans. Our model reliably and reproducibly developed adhesions. Histopathological analyses revealed that monkeys undergoing our novel surgery method exhibited changes consistent with those in monkeys that underwent open abdominal surgery. Furthermore, the cellular components of the adhesion tissue in our monkey model reflected those reported in human adhesion tissue. Furthermore, time-course transcriptomic analyses showed that our model accurately recapitulates the well-known progression cascade of postoperative adhesions. In addition, it identified the upregulation of gene that is absent in rodents. We expect our novel surgical method to be a promising tool for elucidating the detailed biology of postoperative adhesions and for assessing new therapeutic treatments with high translatability to human biology. © The Author(s) 2025.","","Animals; Disease Models, Animal; Gene Expression Profiling; Humans; Macaca fascicularis; Male; Postoperative Complications; Reproducibility of Results; Tissue Adhesions; animal; disease model; etiology; gene expression profiling; human; Macaca fascicularis; male; pathology; postoperative complication; prevention and control; reproducibility; tissue adhesion","","","","","Chugai Pharmaceutical; Kazuaki Yuzawa at Tsukuba Primate Research Center; National Institute of Biomedical Innovation, NIBIO","We thank Shinta Kobayashi, Mika Endo, Kenji Kashima, Yasushi Tomii, Naoko Awasaki, Asuka Ikeda, Takashi Fujitomo and Hideaki Mizuno at Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., as well as Kazuaki Yuzawa at Tsukuba Primate Research Center, National Institutes of Biomedical Innovation, Health and Nutrition for their technical and scientific support.

Methods: This prospective study included 91 eyes from 91 normal subjects. The evaluated parameters were axial length (AL), central corneal thickness (CCT), aqueous depth (AQD), anterior chamber depth (ACD), lens thickness (LT), flattest and steepest meridian keratometry (Kf and Ks), mean keratometry (Km), astigmatism (AST) magnitude, white-to-white (WTW) distance, and pupil diameter (PD). The within-subject standard deviation (Sw), test–retest repeatability (TRT), coefficient of variation (CoV), and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) were calculated to determine the repeatability and reproducibility. Paired t-tests and Bland–Altman plots with 95% limits of agreement (LoA) were employed to assess the agreement. Results: With respect to intraobserver repeatability, the Sw and TRT values of all evaluated parameters were low. Except J45 and PD, the ICCs were all higher than 0.928. The reproducibility Sw and TRT values of Colombo IOL were also low, and ICCs were not lower than 0.900. Comparing Colombo IOL and IOLMaster 700, the 95% LoA of AL, CCT, AQD, ACD, LT, Kf, Ks, Km, AST, J0, J45, WTW and PD ranged from − 0.08 to 0.03 mm, − 21.58 to 5.09 μm, 0.01 to 0.15 mm, − 0.01 to 0.14 mm, − 0.05 to 0.10 mm, − 0.14 to 0.59 D, − 0.31 to 0.40 D, − 0.13 to 0.40 D, − 0.68 to 0.32 D, − 0.09 to 0.34 D, − 0.07 to 0.25 D, 0.11 to 1.47 mm, and − 0.97 to 2.31 mm, respectively. Conclusion: The new SD-OCT-based Colombo IOL biometer demonstrates excellent repeatability and reproducibility. Moreover, it generally agrees well with the SS-OCT-based IOLMaster 700, except for the WTW and PD measurements. © The Author(s) 2025.","Agreement; Ocular biometry; Optical coherence tomography; Repeatability; Reproducibility","","","","","","Ministero della Salute; Rome Foundation, RF; Fudan University, FDU, (yg2023-06, yg2023-26); Fudan University, FDU; Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality, STCSM, (22S11900200, 23XD1420500); Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality, STCSM; Fudan University High-level Talents Program, (TP2022046, 2021318)","This work was supported in part by the Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality (Grant Nos. 22S11900200 and 23XD1420500); EYE & ENT Hospital of Fudan University High-level Talents Program (Grant No. 2021318); Program for Professor of Special Appointment (Eastern Scholar, TP2022046) at Shanghai Institutions of Higher Learning; Medical Engineering Fund of Fudan University (Grant Nos. yg2023-06 and yg2023-26); The contribution of IRCCS Bietti Foundation was supported by Fondazione Roma and the Italian Ministry of Health.

The infectiousness of Plasmodium falciparum gametocytes obtained from individuals to laboratory-reared mosquitoes should be quantified to employ easily applicable assays for evaluating transmission-blocking interventions. This study aimed to establish the relationship between parasite transmission from humans to mosquitoes both within a person and across persons by assessing the variation in the proportion of infected mosquitoes with at least one oocyst (oocyst prevalence) in a direct membrane feeding assay (DMFA) and direct skin landing feeding assay (DSFA) performed at two consecutive time points in the same human subject with P. falciparum gametocytaemia. Methods: A total of 400 adults without symptoms of malaria residing in Western Kenya were screened for the presence of P. falciparum gametocytes. Individuals who tested positive had DMFAs and DSFAs on two subsequent days of feeding, baseline and final visit, to compare mosquito infection rates between the two feeds. Results: Blood samples from 42 individuals testing positive for gametocytes underwent mosquito infection assays. Survival rates of mosquitoes after feeding at baseline and final visit were 13.2 and 11.6 days for DMFA and 12.1 and 11.4 days for DSFA, respectively. The mean oocyst prevalence on feeding at baseline and final visit was 6.3% and 2.2% for DMFA and 5.2% and 2.3% for DSFA, respectively. A not significantly lower prevalence was not observed on at final visit (− 0.016% for DMFA, p = 0.795) and -0.025% for DSFA, p = 0.711 compared to feeding at baseline. The correlation of oocyst prevalence between feeding baseline and final visit for both was low (0.3 95%CI (0.15, 0.51). Exploratory analysis suggests a lower probability of infection on the second day, with lower oocyst density. Conclusions: These findings have implications for future studies and limit the utility of before-after designs in testing transmission-blocking interventions. The findings show comparable infection rates in both DMFA and DSFA, which allows use of less invasive membrane assays in future studies.

This work sets out to highlight the need for reproducibility of computational simulation studies, and to develop the level of professionality in the transportation domain when it comes to open source. Moreover, this work aims to equip the readers with a guide on best practices inspired by the computer science domain, templates for documentation of software and data, and guidelines on repository management and open source. The empirical analysis of more than 11,879 simulation studies and 672 repositories in the field reveals that only few works (less than 2%) share supplementary material alongside the scientific publication, on a mostly mediocre repository quality, but with a strong trend towards more transparency in the last years. Besides, simulation studies with enhanced transparency are found to not receive significantly more citations when compared with studies that do not provide additional repositories. What’s more, a survey of more than 87 transportation researchers conveys that reproducibility is perceived as a significant issue by the community, and that time and legal constraints are the largest impediments to more reproducible research. © The Author(s) 2025.","Computational simulation studies; Natural language processing; Reproducibility; Scientometrics; Survey; Transportation literature","Natural language processing systems; Open source software; Computational simulation; Computational simulation study; Language processing; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Open-source; Reproducibilities; Scientometrics; Simulation studies; Transportation literature; Digital elevation model","","","","","Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich","Open access funding provided by Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich.","Huang J., Cui Y., Zhang L., Tong W., Shi Y., Liu Z., An overview of agent-based models for transport simulation and analysis, Journal of Advanced Transportation, 2022, 1, (2022); Bazzan A.L., Klugl F., A review on agent-based technology for traffic and transportation, The Knowledge Engineering Review, 29, 3, pp. 375-403, (2014); Chen B., Cheng H.H., A review of the applications of agent technology in traffic and transportation systems, IEEE Transactions on intelligent transportation systems, 11, 2, pp. 485-497, (2010); Ronald N., Thompson R., Winter S., Simulating demand-responsive transportation: a review of agent-based approaches, Transport Reviews, 35, 4, pp. 404-421, (2015); Zheng Z., Reasons, challenges, and some tools for doing reproducible transportation research, Communications in Transportation Research, 1, (2021); Dalle O., On reproducibility and traceability of simulations, Proceedings of the 2012 Winter Simulation Conference (WSC), pp. 1-12, (2012); Popper K., Logik Der Forschung, (1935); Popper K., The Logic of Scientific Discovery; Lohmann A., Astivia O.L., Morris T.P., Groenwold R.H., It’s time! ten reasons to start replicating simulation studies, Frontiers in Epidemiology, 2, (2022); Hill D.R., Reproducibility of simulations and high performance computing, ESM 2022, European Simulation and Modelling Conference, pp. 5-9, (2022); (2019); Plesser H.E., Reproducibility vs. replicability: a brief history of a confused terminology, Frontiers in neuroinformatics, 11, 76, (2018); Goodman S.N., Fanelli D., Ioannidis J.P., What does research reproducibility mean?, Science translational medicine, 8, 341, pp. 341-340, (2016); Gundersen O.E., The fundamental principles of reproducibility, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A, 379, 2197, (2021); Sandve G.K., Nekrutenko A., Taylor J., Hovig E., Ten simple rules for reproducible computational research, PLoS computational biology, 9, 10, (2013); Draper N., Applied Regression Analysis, (1998); Riehl K., On the scientometric value of full-text, beyond abstracts and titles: evidence from the business and economic literature, Management Review Quarterly, pp. 1-55, (2024); Merton R.K., die normative struktur der wissenschaft.

We assess interrater variability among eight expert pathologists reviewing histopathological images and clinical metadata of 792 melanoma-suspicious lesions prospectively collected at eight German hospitals. Moreover, we provide access to the largest panel-validated dataset featuring dermoscopic and histopathological images with metadata. Complete agreement is achieved in 53.5% of cases (424/792), and a majority vote (≥ five pathologists) in 90.9% (720/792). Considerable discordance is observed for non-invasive melanomas (complete agreement in only 10/73 cases). The expert panel disagrees with the local pathologists’ and dermatologists’ diagnoses in 14.9% and 33.5% of cases, respectively. This variability highlights the diagnostic challenges of early-stage melanomas and the need to reconsider how ground truth is established in routine care and AI research. Including at least two pathologists or virtual panels may contribute to more consistent diagnostic results. © The Author(s) 2025.","","Adult; Aged; Dermoscopy; Female; Germany; Humans; Male; Melanoma; Middle Aged; Observer Variation; Pathologists; Prospective Studies; Reproducibility of Results; Skin Neoplasms; accuracy assessment; data set; histopathology; metadata; tumor; accuracy; Article; comparative study; confocal laser scanning microscopy; controlled study; decision making; dermatologist; diagnostic test accuracy study; dysplastic nevus; histopathology; human; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; interrater reliability; major clinical study; melanocytic tumor; melanoma; non melanoma skin cancer; pathologist; reproducibility; treatment outcome; university hospital; adult; aged; dermatoscopy; diagnosis; diagnostic imaging; female; Germany; male; melanoma; middle aged; observer variation; pathologist; pathology; procedures; prospective study; reproducibility; skin tumor","","","","","Bundesministerium für Gesundheit, BMG; Ministerium für Soziales und Integration Baden-Württemberg, SozM BW","This study was funded by the Federal Ministry of Health, Berlin, Germany (grant: Skin Classification Project 2) and the Ministry of Health, Social Affairs and Integration Baden-W\u00FCrttemberg, Stuttgart, Germany (grant: sKIn).

Therefore, the objective of this prospective study conducted in China was to evaluate and compare the performance of DTI and DSI in human masticatory muscles. Methods: The differences and reproducibility of architecture characteristics and diffusion properties derived from DTI and DSI were evaluated in the masticatory muscles of healthy volunteers (n = 25). The quality of tracked fiber was analyzed based on anatomical information. To assess the sensitivity of DTI and DSI to muscular microenvironment changes, the architecture characteristics and diffusion properties of the masticatory muscles in patients with temporomandibular joint disorders (TMDs) (n = 25) between different subgroups according to the course of diseases were explored. The paired-samples t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test, Student’s t-test or Mann-Whitney U test, one-way ANOVA or the Kruskal-Wallis test, and the post-hoc multiple comparisons with false discovery rate adjustment were performed. Bland-Altman plots, within-subject coefficient of variation (CV), and relative absolute difference (RAD) were used to evaluate the reproducibility. Results: In the healthy group, DSI generated significantly more fibers in all masticatory muscles (all P < 0.001) and fewer low-quality fibers in most masticatory muscles (P < 0.050) than DTI did. Moreover, higher values of mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) were found in DSI (all P < 0.001). Satisfactory coefficient of variation (< 10%), relative absolute difference (< 10%), and agreement exhibited by the Bland-Altman analysis were found between two scans in both DTI and DSI. Compared with DTI, DSI found additional significant changes in the masticatory muscles of TMDs patients. Conclusions: Although both DTI and DSI allowed reproducible assessment of masticatory muscles, significant differences existed between them. DSI was more sensitive to the microenvironment changes of the masticatory muscles in TMDs patients. © The Author(s) 2025.","Diffusion spectrum imaging; Diffusion tensor imaging; Masticatory muscles; Reproducibility; Temporomandibular joint disorders","Adult; Diffusion Tensor Imaging; Female; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Male; Masticatory Muscles; Middle Aged; Pilot Projects; Prospective Studies; Reproducibility of Results; Temporomandibular Joint Disorders; Young Adult; Article; axial diffusivity; clinical article; controlled study; diagnostic test accuracy study; diffusion spectrum imaging; diffusion tensor imaging; fractional anisotropy; human; image analysis; Kruskal Wallis test; lateral pterygoid muscle; masseter muscle; masticatory muscle; mean diffusivity; microenvironment; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pilot study; radial diffusivity; reproducibility; sensitivity analysis; spectral imaging; T1 weighted imaging; temporomandibular joint disorder; Wilcoxon signed ranks test; adult; comparative study; diagnostic imaging; female; male; middle aged; pathology; procedures; prospective study; reproducibility; temporomandibular joint disorder; three-dimensional imaging; young adult","","","DSI Studio; GraphPad Prism 9, Graphpad; ITK-SNAP Version 3.8.0; MAGNETOM Prisma, Siemens Healthcare, Germany; Origin software Version 2023b, Origin Lab, United States; online application software SPSSAU version 23.0","Graphpad; Origin Lab, United States; Siemens Healthcare, Germany","Fujian Medical University, FJMU, (2022QH1101); Fujian Medical University, FJMU; Joint Funds for the Innovation of Science and Technology, Fujian Province, (2021Y9122)","This study has received funding from the Startup Fund for Scientific Research of Fujian Medical University (No.2022QH1101), and Joint Funds for the Innovation of Science and Technology, Fujian Province (No.2021Y9122).

The framework combines feature extraction, deep learning with attention mechanisms, and radiomics to ensure accuracy, interpretability, and practical use in tumor analysis. Materials and methods: This retrospective study used data from 2,560 esophageal cancer patients across multiple clinical centers, collected from 2018 to 2023. The dataset included CT scan images and clinical information, representing a variety of cancer grades and types. Standardized CT imaging protocols were followed, and experienced radiologists manually segmented the tumor regions. Only high-quality data were used in the study. A total of 215 radiomic features were extracted using the SERA platform. The study used two deep learning models—DenseNet121 and EfficientNet-B0—enhanced with attention mechanisms to improve accuracy. A combined classification approach used both radiomic and deep learning features, and machine learning models like Random Forest, XGBoost, and CatBoost were applied. These models were validated with strict training and testing procedures to ensure effective cancer grading. Results: This study analyzed the reliability and performance of radiomic and deep learning features for grading esophageal cancer. Radiomic features were classified into four reliability levels based on their ICC (Intraclass Correlation) values. Most of the features had excellent (ICC > 0.90) or good (0.75 < ICC ≤ 0.90) reliability. Deep learning features extracted from DenseNet121 and EfficientNet-B0 were also categorized, and some of them showed poor reliability. The machine learning models, including XGBoost and CatBoost, were tested for their ability to grade cancer. XGBoost with Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) gave the best results for radiomic features, with an AUC (Area Under the Curve) of 91.36%. For deep learning features, XGBoost with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) gave the best results using DenseNet121, while CatBoost with RFE performed best with EfficientNet-B0, achieving an AUC of 94.20%. Combining radiomic and deep features led to significant improvements, with XGBoost achieving the highest AUC of 96.70%, accuracy of 96.71%, and sensitivity of 95.44%. The combination of both DenseNet121 and EfficientNet-B0 models in ensemble models achieved the best overall performance, with an AUC of 95.14% and accuracy of 94.88%. Conclusions: This study improves esophageal cancer grading by combining radiomics and deep learning. It enhances diagnostic accuracy, reproducibility, and interpretability, while also helping in personalized treatment planning through better tumor characterization.
